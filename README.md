#Donald Trump Bot
##About
This is just a side project to create a GroupMe bot. I used the Django 
framework as a starting point for hosting the bot on Heroku.

##Instructions
To have the bot send a random tweet from @realDonaldTrump use the command: 
`@TheDonald`
With the command `@TheDonald how "A" is "B"?` the bot will return `"A" is 
"random%" "B"`
Any isntance of `wall` will return `I'll build it higher and make "USER" pay 
for it.`
